      <title>Getting of the Band-wagon</title>

      <description>“The bandwagon effect is the term used to describe the tendency for people to adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes simply because others are doing so.” …
 Yes, yes, as a &amp;ldquo;boomer&amp;rdquo; now maybe I&amp;rsquo;m whining as usual. Even so, since you don&amp;rsquo;t have to read this, I can keep whining, right? Although I am actually very old, I think my soul ages before actual, physical me. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I suddenly lose my enthusiasm when I see something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for so much being watched, read or expressed by “popular culture” or should I say “bandwagon”.</description>

      <description>Sweet Smell of Success is a 1957 American film noir drama film directed by Alexander Mackendrick, starring Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison which is one of my favorite noir films. But I’m not going to talk about this movie. While I was listening to movie’s soundtrack suddenly found myself to questioning what success really is and I wanted to clear my thoughts. …
 Generally, people think success connected with status and financial terms.</description>

      <title>A Time Spent Searching Movies Set in 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s</title>

      <description>Time passes so quickly, it REALLY does!. The value of somethings can be quite precious since time passes so quickly. If I leave aside the metaphorical talk, I am stuck in the atmosphere of the 80s, which I have not experienced, and the 90s period, which I&amp;rsquo;ve seen these good old days cannot forget. I think that both the excitement of hearing from my old friends and watching so many movies about 90&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s abreact this feeling a lot.</description>

      <description>“As a white-collar employee Stanley, only presses the buttons after commands he receives. One day he worried because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t received any commands and then realized his co-workers are gone. But no worries, a narrator appears to help him(?)” …
 Narrator tells Stanley exactly what to do. But how reliable is this narrator? Does Stanley need help? Or does he not have free will of his own? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t he make a choice in the end, whether it fits the narrators say or not?</description>

      <description>“It&amp;rsquo;s the summer of 2005, all the windows of our house were open (even if we’d be moved to next year) … As a gentle wind wanders through the rooms, that rhythm would never leave my mind, echoes in my ears:
…
Time goes by so slowly
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do”
Well, it’s really interesting to find that song playing on the radio and the artist who was singing, but maybe I’ll tell you next time.</description>
