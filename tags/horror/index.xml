      <description>Time passes so quickly, it REALLY does!. The value of somethings can be quite precious since time passes so quickly. If I leave aside the metaphorical talk, I am stuck in the atmosphere of the 80s, which I have not experienced, and the 90s period, which I have lived and cannot forget. I think that both the excitement of hearing from my old friends and many of the movies I have watched contribute to this atmosphere a lot.</description>
