      <description>Time passes so quickly, it REALLY does!. The value of somethings can be quite precious since time passes so quickly. If I leave aside the metaphorical talk, I am stuck in the atmosphere of the 80s, which I have not experienced, and the 90s period, which I&amp;rsquo;ve seen these good old days cannot forget. I think that both the excitement of hearing from my old friends and watching so many movies about 90&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s abreact this feeling a lot.</description>

      <description>The plot: â€œGeorge McAllister, the black sheep of a wealthy family who has squandered his share of the family inheritance, and lives in constant jealousy, hatred and resentment of his half-brother Barry, who has been supporting him. George gets his girlfriend, Carlotta Duval, a job as Barry&amp;rsquo;s nurse with the plan of eventually marrying him. She does, but instead of going ahead with the original plan or getting rid of Barry, inheriting his money and marrying George, she finds that she is really in love with Barry.</description>
