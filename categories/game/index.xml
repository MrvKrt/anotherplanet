      <description>“As a white-collar employee Stanley, only presses the buttons after commands he receives. One day he worried because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t received any commands and then realized his co-workers are gone. But no worries, a narrator appears to help him(?)” …
 Narrator tells Stanley exactly what to do. But how reliable is this voice-over? Why does Stanley need help? Or does he not have free will of his own? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t he make a choice in the end, whether it fits the narrator or not?</description>
