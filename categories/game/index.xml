      <description>Martha Is Dead is a horror game released on February 24, 2022. But beyond being a horror game, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a psychological experience. It deals with personal and so complex topics that it is obvious that some players may find it triggering.
 Even it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;perfect experience for me&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m sure most players consider it’s just a walking simulation. (Not that I care…)
The game starts with a folk tale, takes place in 1944 in Italy, during the World War II.</description>

      <description>“As a white-collar employee Stanley, only presses the buttons after commands he receives. One day he worried because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t received any commands and then realized his co-workers are gone. But no worries, a narrator appears to help him(?)” …
 Narrator tells Stanley exactly what to do. But how reliable is this narrator? Does Stanley need help? Or does he not have free will of his own? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t he make a choice in the end, whether it fits the narrators say or not?</description>
