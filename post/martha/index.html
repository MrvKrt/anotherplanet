        <h1>Beyond a Horror Game – Martha is Dead - Sun, Mar 6, 2022</h1>

    <p class="lead">This is the review of Martha is Dead I wrote on Steam</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/515960/Martha_Is_Dead/">Martha Is Dead</a> is a horror game released on February 24, 2022. But beyond being a horror game, it&rsquo;s more of a psychological experience. It deals with personal and so complex topics that it is obvious that some players may find it triggering.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;perfect experience for me&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure most players consider it’s just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Walking_simulators">walking simulation</a>. (Not that I care…)</p>
<p>The game starts with a folk tale, takes place in 1944 in Italy, during the World War II. As the player, we control Giulia, who goes to the lake shore to take pictures. While taking photos, she sees his twin sister dead, and the real story of the game begins right here.</p>
<p>I want to scribble something on the storytelling rather than the technical part of the game. Because although time has passed since I finished the game, I still remember how the game made me feel.
I was very impressed with Martha is Dead. Of course, I won&rsquo;t write about what affect me, but it made me think more than disturb. It made me question how ephemeral some of the things I attribute a meaning to. With the end, the game slapped the hard truth on my face. That&rsquo;s what I liked most about this bittersweet effect left on me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoilers ahead folks!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After finished the game, it is revealed that Giulia has been in a mental institution the entire time, and that the Martha events are just a figment of her imagination. Of course, it is possible to make different inference here. Whether her parents, lover, nanny, or even Martha even exists is questionable. But who can resist the imagination of a young, troubled, and traumatized mind? No doubt, it’s easy to guess the “profound” effect of experiencing such mind on many players, including myself. Game delicately touches on sensitive topics, from murder to suicide, domestic abuse to paranoia, trauma to blood and brutality.</p>
<p>The narrative of the game is as impressive as its story. Atmosphere, contexts, and characters are very well reflected. Even just consider these, it is possible to say that the game is much more than a walking simulation.</p>
<p>Martha is Dead is hard to play. Especially if it is a game that deals with a sick mind&hellip; All part of the game is carefully thought-out and relevant with story and exploration of Giulia&rsquo;s mental deterioration. All in all, Martha is Dead is a simple game that tells a very difficult but important story which is worth experiencing.</p>
