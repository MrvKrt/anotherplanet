<p><em><strong>The plot:
“George McAllister, the black sheep of a wealthy family who has squandered his share of the family inheritance, and lives in constant jealousy, hatred and resentment of his half-brother Barry, who has been supporting him. George gets his girlfriend, Carlotta Duval, a job as Barry&rsquo;s nurse with the plan of eventually marrying him. She does, but instead of going ahead with the original plan or getting rid of Barry, inheriting his money and marrying George, she finds that she is really in love with Barry.”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a fan of the film noir theme, I watched all the popular films of the period. (Well, kinda) For this reason, it can be difficult to find good movie of such a rare theme. I can say that it was by accidently started watching this movie. Because I thought I was watching Glenn Ford&rsquo;s (one of my favorite actors) <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039396/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_7">Framed (1947)</a>, another 1947 movie in my archive. After <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039386/?ref_=ttsnd_snd_tt">“The Flame”</a> title was appeared, I decided not to close the movie and watch it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Warning: The movie may or may not be full spoilers. At your own risk!</em></strong></p>

<p>Without getting into technical issues, I just want to scribble something about what was in mind in generally.  Director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041678?ref_=tt_cl_dr_1">John H. Auer</a> is usually known as producer. Still, I can say that he did a good job in this movie. The actors did their best job either. But when I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0707843?ref_=tt_cl_t_2">Vera Ralston</a> (played Carlotta) I realized that she would not be the <em>femme fatale</em> of the movie. Because it was obvious that she did not have this aura. While watching you see this task was given to Helen (played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0235823?ref_=tt_cl_t_7">Constance Dowling</a>) although it is not so much. But the acting that I fell in love with belongs to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140865?ref_=tt_cl_t_1">John Carroll</a> (George McAllister), who plays Barry&rsquo;s (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656745?ref_=tt_cl_t_3">Robert Paige</a>) half-brother.</p>
<p>As movie goes, we (not me) think that Carlotta will play the femme fatale. Because she, will be put in Berry’s (other dying half-brother) money and return to George. But she realized that Berry is a good character with lovely heart. On the other hand, she feels religious and conscientious pressure with the conscience of backstabbing Barry. It is at this point that Carlotta ceased to be a femme fatale and becomes a <a href="https://examplum.com/translation/french-english/femme%20vivant">femme vivant</a> character. (But I felt it the first time I saw Vera Ralston in the lead role like mentioned before) I really liked that this transformation was incorporated into the movie.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, Constance Dowling&rsquo;s Helen character, who is a side-wheel <em>femme fatale</em>, is included in the script in a very good place. Even though it&rsquo;s not exactly femme fatale, I can say that she played very her character. Also, one of my favorite factors in a noir movie is the nightclub and the song duo. In the movie, this duo was quoted with the song <strong>&ldquo;Love Me or Leave Me&rdquo;</strong>, which I really liked the performance of Constance Dowling.</p>

<p>Finally, George McAllister, who pictured the good and the bad character in the movie, became my favorite. In the opening scene of the movie, the phone call to the police reminded me of my favorite movie, Double Indemnity, so the movie had a head start for me. 
However, as someone who has watched many noir films, I can say that <em>The Flame</em> is a good, solid film noir, it is in the category of watchable without too much expectation.</p>
