      <description>The plot: “George McAllister, the black sheep of a wealthy family who has squandered his share of the family inheritance, and lives in constant jealousy, hatred and resentment of his half-brother Barry, who has been supporting him. George gets his girlfriend, Carlotta Duval, a job as Barry&amp;rsquo;s nurse with the plan of eventually marrying him. She does, but instead of going ahead with the original plan or getting rid of Barry, inheriting his money and marrying George, she finds that she is really in love with Barry.</description>

      <description>“As a white-collar employee Stanley, only presses the buttons after commands he receives. One day he worried because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t received any commands and then realized his co-workers are gone. But no worries, a narrator appears to help him(?)” …
 Narrator tells Stanley exactly what to do. But how reliable is this voice-over? Why does Stanley need help? Or does he not have free will of his own? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t he make a choice in the end, whether it fits the narrator or not?</description>

      <description>“It&amp;rsquo;s the summer of 2005, all the windows of our house were open (even if we’d be moved to next year) … As a gentle wind wanders through the rooms, that rhythm would never leave my mind, echoes in my ears:
…
Time goes by so slowly
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do”
Well, it’s really interesting to find that song playing on the radio and the artist who was singing, but maybe I’ll tell you next time.</description>
