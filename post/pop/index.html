<p>Yes, yes, as a &ldquo;boomer&rdquo; now maybe I&rsquo;m whining as usual. Even so, since you don&rsquo;t have to read this, I can keep whining, right? Although I am actually very old, I think my soul ages before actual, physical me. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I suddenly lose my enthusiasm when I see something that I&rsquo;ve been waiting for so much being watched, read or expressed by ‚Äúpopular culture‚Äù or should I say <a href="https://www.mindspeaks.co/pop-culture/the-cancel-culture-and-the-bandwagon-effect/">‚Äúbandwagon‚Äù</a>.</p>
<p>But I totally forgot that it&rsquo;s fashionable not to like something because everyone likes it. Is not it difficult to understand whether I&rsquo;m in this bandwagon or not? Well, at least those who close to (really) me know this dilemma very well and that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

<p><strong>The fact that I was really fed up and demented by this toxic ‚Äúpop‚Äù culture forced me to write this piece of word. Because I want to write down this situation that is overflowing from my brain and throw it aside to make room for more ‚Äúuseful‚Äù information and emotions. Because you know, this is my (mind) - space junk.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People whose do not have own tastes and personalities go after a person and set the ‚Äúfake agenda‚Äù of the world and tell what to watch or read, and ‚Äúfunny efforts‚Äù to be marginal, are now boring enough to make me a neanderthal. If these questions sound familiar to you welcome to the club, know that you are not alone. And there is no solution to get rid of it.
‚Ä¢	Have you watched Squid Game or Arcane, which has a great, amazing plot story?
‚Ä¢	Hollywood is doing great, have you seen the last Spiderman (or one of the millions of other Marvel movies)? 
‚Ä¢	I&rsquo;ve been listening to music since I was born on Spotify wrapped, wow! Check out these ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù artists I&rsquo;ve been listening to!
‚Ä¢	Whaat, you still haven&rsquo;t made the latest trend on Instagram? Or you still don&rsquo;t use Instagram!?! Pew.</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<p><a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bandwagon-effect/">A lack of individual critical thinking can have particularly damaging implications when it is widespread. Social and political movements are often fueled by the bandwagon effect.</a></p>
<p>It takes time to reflect on a behavior or idea and decide whether it is worth supporting. Many of us see widespread adoption as a sign that we need to take a similar stance. This is where we skip the lengthy self-assessment process and rely on other people as measured by widespread popularity.<a href="https://www.amazon.com.tr/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">*</a> (Or, I think, we are too lazy to think!) When this is the case, the results are not so surprising, are they?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, right. But I am not in that wagon. Okay, are you sure?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-bandwagon-effect-2795895"><strong>When it seems like everyone is adopting a certain fad diet, people become more likely to try the diet themselves. People are more likely to vote for the candidate that they think is winning. Many people begin wearing a certain style of clothing as they see others adopt the same fashions. As more and more people begin listening to a particular song or musical group, it becomes more likely that other individuals will listen as well. As increasing numbers of people start using certain online social networking websites, other individuals become more likely to begin using those sites as well. The bandwagon effect can also influence how posts are shared as well as interactions within online groups.</strong></a></p>

<p>Now, you‚Äôre really sure?</p>

<p>I get it, you want to fit in. You want to be right; you want to feel like you belong somewhere, but you end up becoming alike as part of a toxic culture. You don&rsquo;t even realize it. Here is the inevitable end that awaits the whole world -even me-.</p>
<p>I intended to write more of a scientific article, but since speculation is important to many, it was just a reproach&hellip;</p>
